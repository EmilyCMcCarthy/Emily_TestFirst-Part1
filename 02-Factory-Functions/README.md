#02-Factory-Functions
<hr>

###Overview

The Calculator TestSpec is very similar to 01-Properties.  The difference is instead of passing a function an object to add properties to the object, you will create a function (without passing an object to it as an argument) that **returns** an object with properties. These properties can be of any JavaScript type including functions!  The function will create the object and return the object.

This pattern is called creating a **Factory Function**, because your function is acting as a factory for making a certain pattern of object.
